Build an Event Planner

Requirements:

1. Display a calendar view similar to Google Calendar.

2. Highlight the current date.

3. Allow users to add events to specific dates, and visually highlight those dates.

4. Starting calendar from correct day for every month.

Bonus Features:

1. Add navigation buttons to switch between months and years.

2. Only show and highlight events for the currently visible month and year.

Doing all this in 45 minutes is challenging what do you think?

This problem evaluates your understanding of the following concepts:

- Efficient usage of useMemo
- Structuring React components with proper architecture
- Building type-safe components using TypeScript
- Working with interfaces and generics
- Handling dates using date-fns (no need to memorize it—you’re allowed to use the internet)
